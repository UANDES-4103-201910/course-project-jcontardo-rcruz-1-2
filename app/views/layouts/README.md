ASSIGNMENT 2

For this delivery, we fix the problems of the previous deliveries, that is, we add all the missing associations in the models (has_many, belongs_to, has_one, etc.), we also add the missing validations for each of the classes. Change the entity User_type to user_type.

We implement the main views of our program, such as, home, profile, blacklist, who are you.

To run the website, we use html files, not html.erb, therefore opens the file in the browser, not through the local server "localhost".
